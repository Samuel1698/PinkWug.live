# Comic & Store web application for PinkWug


Dependencies:
* [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)

To run this application you need
* Ruby 3.0.2
* Rails 6.0.3.7
* Webpacker


## A work in progress
I started working on this project with the permission of PinkWug to practice what I learned in the Noble Desktop Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
This web app is currently in deployment, subject to many changes as I work closely with the creator of the comics this page showcases.

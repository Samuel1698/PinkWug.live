	<p>Hey, welcome to my website! I'm Pink and I make comics on ✨ society ✨. I aim to make my comics accessible to the general public and raise awareness on important issues in a digestible and shareable format. Political apathy is a real problem and I wanted to play a small role in getting more people to care about civil and labor rights.</p>
	<p>If you wanna  support me what I do, you can sub to my Ko-fi or Patreon and get some cool perks like wallpapers and high-res prints! And as always, you help out simply by sharing and engaging with my comics!</p>
	<p>If you have any questions, feel free to drop by my comfy Discord server. I'm very active there and you will see my opinions on most stuff.</p>
	<p>For business inquiries: pinkwug@gmail.com</p>
